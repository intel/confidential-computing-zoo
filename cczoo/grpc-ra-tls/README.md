# RA-TLS Enhanced gRPC

This solution presents an enhanced [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) (Google Remote Procedure Call) framework to
guarantee security during transmission and runtime via two-way
[RA-TLS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.05863)
(Intel SGX Remote Attestation with Transport Layer Security) based on
[TEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment) (Trusted Execution Environment).


## Introduction

[gRPC](https://grpc.io/) is a modern, open source, high-performance remote procedure call (RPC)
framework that can run anywhere. It enables client and server applications to communicate
transparently, and simplifies the building of connected systems. For securing gRPC connections, the
SSL/TLS authentication mechanisms is built-in to gRPC.

gRPC is designed to work with a variety of authentication mechanisms, making it easy to safely
use gRPC to talk to other systems. For securing gRPC connections, the SSL/TLS authentication
mechanisms is built-in to gRPC, it can guarantee the security in transmission.

Transport Layer Security ([TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)) the
successor of the now-deprecated Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a cryptographic protocol designed to
provide communications security over a computer network. The current version is
[TLS 1.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446) defined in August 2018.

gRPC RA-TLS integrates TEE and Intel SGX RA-TLS technology, it establish a standard TLS (v1.3)
connection in TEE based on gRPC TLS/SSL mechanism. TEE guarantees code and data loaded inside to be
protected with respect to confidentiality and integrity in runtime.

During the TLS handshake procedure, the public key certificates are used for key exchange. The
public key certificate is [X.509](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509) format. It is either signed
by a certificate authority (CA) or is self-signed for binding an identity to a public key.

Remote attestation is performed during the connection setup by embedding the attestation evidence
into the endpoints TLS public key certificate.

In the gRPC TLS handshake phase, the certificates is generated and verified as
following.

| Generate X.509 certificate | Verify X.509 certificate |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| 1. Generate the RSA key pair <br> 2. Generate the X.509 certificate with the RSA key pair <br> 3. Embed the hash of RSA public key into SGX quote report signed by the [attestation key](https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/dcap-1.0.1/docs/Intel_SGX_ECDSA_QuoteGenReference_DCAP_API_Linux_1.0.1.pdf) <br> 4. Embed the quote report into X.509 as a v3 extension <br> 5. Self-sign the X.509 certificate | 1. Verify the X.509 certificate by the default gRPC TLS procedure <br> 2. Parse the quote report from the X.509 extension <br> 3. Verify the quote report by the Intel DCAP interface <br> 4. Compare the hash of X.509 certificate with the hash embedded in the quote reprot <br> 5. Compare the enclave's identity embedded in the quote report against the expected identity |

This solution supports the two-way RA-TLS verification between gRPC server and client. It means
client and server both need to generate the certificates and verify each other.


## Trust execution environment
A trusted execution environment (TEE) is a secure area of a main processor. It guarantees code and
data loaded inside to be protected with respect to confidentiality and integrity, Data integrity —
prevents unauthorized entities from altering data when any entity outside the TEE processes data,
Code integrity — the code in the TEE cannot be replaced or modified by unauthorized entities.
This is done by implementing unique, immutable, and confidential architectural security such as
Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions).

Intel SGX technology offers hardware-based memory encryption that isolates specific application code
 and data in memory. This solution provides the different gRPC framework running on different TEE.

 library OS Based on Intel SGX technology, designed to run a single application with minimal host
 requirements.

## Build and installation

Currently, we only support building and installation from the source code. It will generate a docker
images for developing the gRPC RA-TLS application.

1. Build TEE docker image

   - On Gramine

        Refer to cczoo/common/docker/gramine/README.md

        ```
        cd cczoo/common/docker/gramine

        base_image=ubuntu:20.04
        image_tag=gramine-sgx-dev:v1.2-ubuntu20.04-latest

        ./build_docker_image.sh ${base_image} ${image_tag}
        ```

        `ubuntu:18.04` and `ubuntu:20.04` could be selected as base_image.

   - On Occlum

        Refer to cczoo/common/docker/occlum/README.md

        ```bash
        docker pull occlum/occlum:0.26.3-ubuntu20.04

        cd cczoo/common/docker/occlum

        base_image=occlum/occlum:0.26.3-ubuntu20.04
        image_tag=occlum-sgx-dev:0.26.3-ubuntu20.04-latest
        ./build_docker_image.sh ${base_image} ${image_tag}
        ```

2. Build gRPC RA-TLS docker image based on TEE docker image

   - On Gramine

        ```bash
        cd cczoo/grpc-ra-tls/gramine

        base_image=gramine-sgx-dev:v1.2-ubuntu20.04-latest
        image_tag=grpc-ratls-sgx-dev:graminev1.2-ubuntu20.04-latest
        ./build_docker_image.sh ${base_image} ${image_tag}
        ```
        
        `gramine-sgx-dev:v1.2-ubuntu20.04-latest` and `gramine-sgx-dev:v1.2-ubuntu-20.04-latest` 
        could be selected as base_image.

   - On Occlum

        ```bash
        cd cczoo/grpc-ra-tls/occlum

        base_image=occlum-sgx-dev:0.26.3-ubuntu20.04-latest
        image_tag=grpc-ratls-sgx-dev:occlum0.26.3-ubuntu20.04-latest
        ./build_docker_image.sh ${base_image} ${image_tag}
        ```

        `occlum-sgx-dev:0.26.3-ubuntu18.04` and `occlum-sgx-dev:0.26.3-ubuntu20.04` 
        could be selected as base_image.

## Config the remote attestation

For saving the expected measurement values of remote application enclave, we create a json template
as following. It is loaded in gRPC server or client initialization.

Refer to `cczoo/grpc-ra-tls/grpc/common/dynamic_config.json`

```json
{
    "verify_mr_enclave": "on",
    "verify_mr_signer": "on",
    "verify_isv_prod_id": "on",
    "verify_isv_svn": "on",
    "sgx_mrs": [
        {
            "mr_enclave": "",
            "mr_signer": "",
            "isv_prod_id": "0",
            "isv_svn": "0"
        }
    ],
}
```
In Gramine examples, the mr_enclave and mr_signer are automatically parsed in `build.sh`.

Refer to `cczoo/grpc-ra-tls/gramine/CI-Examples/grpc/cpp/ratls/build.sh`

```bash
function get_env() {
    gramine-sgx-get-token -s grpc.sig -o /dev/null | grep $1 | awk -F ":" '{print $2}' | xargs
}

function generate_json() {
    cd ${RUNTIME_TMP_PATH}/$1
    jq ' .sgx_mrs[0].mr_enclave = ''"'`get_env mr_enclave`'" | .sgx_mrs[0].mr_signer = ''"'`get_env
    mr_signer`'" ' ${GRPC_PATH}/dynamic_config.json > ${RUNTIME_TMP_PATH}/$2/dynamic_config.json
    cd -
}
```

For isv_prod_id and isv_svn value, please refer to the values defined in libOS configuration files.
In Gramine, it is defined in the template file.
