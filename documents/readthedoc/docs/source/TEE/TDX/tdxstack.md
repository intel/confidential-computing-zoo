# Global OSVs Support for Intel TDX

The global OSVs below build early access to Intel TDX technology while the respective upstream communities iterate through the review process.

These communities provide the documentations and scripts to enable TDX functionality both as a guest (VM) and as a hypervisor (host) capable of running isolated guests on hardware with Intel TDX support.

Users can deploy TDX stack with selected distribution to the TDX-capable platform quickly.
